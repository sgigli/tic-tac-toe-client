## Technologies used
GIT, GitHub, Bootstrap, API

## Planning and execution
To start, I wrote down user stories and drew a wireframe
of the site, wanting to make it clear and coherent. I planned out the game logic
by first abstracting the steps and then trying to write the code for them.
Having a picture of how the game would flow helped me when bumps in the code
came up. Writing the game logic, I tried to keep the code simple, asking myself
if there were cleaner ways to go about the tasks. I then connected to the API,
writing from separate linked files for organzation, and registering its
responses in places that best fit with the game logic.

## Unsolved problems
- How to register incomplete games
- Having the game restart when the user signs out 
- Implementing more engaging styling
- Making more responsive to window re-sizing
